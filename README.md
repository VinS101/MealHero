Meal Hero puts the control in the volunteersâ€™ hands. 

Each volunteer can choose the route they want. The application tracks previous routes for each volunteer and makes smart suggestions for future routes based on this information. 

Meal Hero outshines its competitors by not only offering GPS directions to each route, but optimizing the routes so each delivery can be more efficient and cost effective, saving both time and money. 

Meal Hero allows volunteers to document any medical issues with each client and also notifies volunteers about important client information such as medical issues. 
This allows volunteers to always be prepared to assist. In case of medical emergency, Meal Hero offers information such as address and contact info, for local transportation and medical service locations.


These are only a few of the reasons Meal Hero is the best choice for your senior service needs.
